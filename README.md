<h2>Design Process</h2>
  
I created this website with the intention of wanting to make use of the Pokémon Trading Card Game(TCG) api to show users a collection of Pokémon card sets and they are able to select a certain card from the Pokémon card set and view the information about the card that they have chosen. Another reason why I created Pokécard Finder was due to my interests of collecting Pokémon cards and I want to translate my passion through this website. Thus, with the creation of this website, my targeted audience, which are fans of Pokémon or fans of the Pokémon TCG  are able to enjoy the benefits of being able to search information for their desired Pokémon card. 

Before creating the website, I had to think of what kind of website design is suitable for users and how are they able to traverse through the website from the process of choosing a Pokémon card set to choosing their desired Pokémon card. Thus, I had to look into many different Pokémon tcg sites as well as the official Pokémon website to gather critical information as since these kinds of websites appeal to the same audience that my website is targeted for, I had to take reference to such sites. 

I also had to create a wireframe in order to give me a clear idea and give me a reference on how the structure of the website would look like for both desktop and mobile view.

<h2>Features</h2>
  
There is a variety of features in this site to allow the website to be presented in a visually-appealing manner and ensure that the user is able to have an enjoyable time when navigating the website. Some of the features are also needed for the website to display the content it is intended to show in the first place to users.

1. Using multiple features of Bootstrap v5.0 such as the grid layout, the card component as well as the spacing aligning helps the website to look visually pleasing towards the user and content is not cluttered and instead organised smoothly.
2. Multiple javascript files that gathers data from Pokémon TCG Developers API and translates it into the various different pages of the website and these scripts gather the latest information as the API is updated so that it ensures that all Pokémon card sets is displayed to the user.
3. Responsive clickable content so that it makes it easier for users to know where to navigate to.

<h3>Extra features not included in wireframe</h3>
  
I have included a filter section that allows users to filter Pokémon cards based on its type and these types include the Trainer card, the Pokémon card as well as the Energy card. The reason for including this feature is because I felt that users might be overwhelmed with the multitude of Pokémon cards in a particular set so by filtering the cards by type, they are able to shorten the amount of time needed to find the Pokémon card he/she wants.
  
<h2>Testing</h2>
  
Testing is an important part of creating a website as to search for bugs or to find more ways to improve the website. This website has been tested various times through two main mediums, which is laptop and mobile display which is used by many users to ensure that it is suitable for as much devices as possible

These are the list of screen sizes that has been tested:
1. 1920 x 1080 pixels (Laptop Web display size)
3. 375 x 812 pixels (IPhone X display size)
